# Superheroes game
The following project is an implementation of an [idea for a simple game](https://github.com/apohllo/obiektowe-lab/blob/master/proj2/Superbohaterowie.md) as a part of the Object Oriented Programming course at AGH UST. **Authors: Aleksandra Smela and Julia Smerdel**.


## Bajtlandia is in trouble
When the world heard that **Henry Cavill is no longer playing Superman**, everyone lost hope. “Roads were empty. Citizens were gathering and crying together, it was awful, we did not know what to do.” The atmosphere was tense, time was rough. **Everyone was lost. Until they were found.**

**11.02.2023.** This date will be remembered forever by the Bajtlandia’s residents. Why? That is the day when **five horsemen of the help** arrived and brought the spark of hope. A combination of **pedantical Sherlock Horns**, **fire-resistant Teddy McBurn**, **intelligent Bug Buster**, **strong Rock Rocky** and **strategic thinking You** is the last hope for the citizens. They relay on you, **will you be the real superhero?**

As the commander, you are to lead the whole team. Tell each hero where to go, what to do and save the city. 

## Basic rules
To move a hero, choose him from the panel on the right by clicking on a picture and control him with arrows on your keyboard. 

There are 4 types of problems appearing in Bajtalndia – fire, detective puzzle, technical issue and supervillain problem. To resolve any of them, hero needs to be on the same spot on the map as the problem. 

To see the description of either a hero or problem, click on it and information will appear at the bottom of the screen. Legend of other symbols can be found in the game.

More details can be found [here](https://github.com/apohllo/obiektowe-lab/blob/master/proj2/Superbohaterowie.md) or by clicking on the “rules” button in the application.

You have 60 days and time is starting right now. Good luck.
